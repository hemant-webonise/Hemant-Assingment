<h4> Proxy - The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder object for another object and controls access to this other object.</h4>

<code>The objects participating in this pattern are:
<body>
    <h3>Client </h3> In sample code: the run() function
        calls Proxy to request an operation
    <h3>Proxy </h3>In sample code: GeoProxy
        provides an interface similar to the real object
        maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the real object
        handles requests and forwards these to the real object
    <h3>RealSubject </h3>In sample code: GeoCoder
        defines the real object for which service is requested
    <h1>-</h1>
</body>
</code>
